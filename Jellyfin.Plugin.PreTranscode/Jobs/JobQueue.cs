/// 15 ms to write) with the queue lock held throughout. A sweep that enqueues 50,000 items used to do
/// that 50,000 times over a growing file — tens of minutes of pure I/O, hundreds of gigabytes written,
/// and the lock held almost continuously, which is what made the queue page crawl while a sweep ran.
/// </para>

/// So the two high-frequency, low-value writes — enqueueing, and the transient "probing"/"verifying"
/// status detail — are coalesced into one write every <see cref="FlushInterval"/> instead. Everything
